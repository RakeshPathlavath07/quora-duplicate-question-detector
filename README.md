#  Quora Duplicate Question Detection App (Streamlit)

This project builds a web-based application using Streamlit to detect whether two questions from Quora are duplicates or not. The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, feature engineering, and a machine learning model to predict question similarity.

## Features & Engineering

- **Text Preprocessing**:
  - Lowercasing
  - Removing punctuation, stopwords
  - Lemmatization (using spaCy)
- **Similarity Features**:
  - Common words count
  - Total words ratio
  - Fuzzy string matching scores
  - Token set ratio and partial ratios

---

## Machine Learning

- Trained multiple models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost) on extracted features.
- Used cross-validation for reliable results.
- Final model chosen based on highest F1-score and ROC-AUC.

##  Streamlit App

The user interface allows:
- Input of two custom questions
- Real-time prediction of "Duplicate" or "Not Duplicate"
- Confidence score
- Display of extracted similarity metrics


## To run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
